Health Project Work:-
---------------------
1.	Load a public PDF document (e.g., a health report from WHO or any other report).
2.	Process the document:
	Load the PDF
	Split it into chunks
	Define overlap for better context retention
	Vectorize and store it in a Vector Database (FAISS)
3. Embed custom roles into the prompting process using a SYSTEM_PROMPT and USER_ROLES.
4. User Role-based Question Answering:
	Different users (like Doctor, Physician, Patient) may ask the same question.
	The response should be customized based on the role of the user.
5. Use Gemini 1.5 via LangChain (LLM as the backend for answering questions).
6. Create modular code by importing roles and prompts (e.g., from .prompts import USER_ROLES).

Use cases that i am willing to follow:-   
1.	PDF Upload and Processing
    Allow users to upload a PDF to use as the knowledge source.
2. Document Splitting and Chunking
    Split the document into text chunks with defined overlap for better context.
3. Text Embedding and Vector Storage
    Convert chunks to vector embeddings and store them in a FAISS vector database.
4. Role-Based Query System
    Let users select a predefined role (e.g., Doctor, Patient) before querying.
5. Dynamic System Prompting
    Customize the system prompt for Gemini based on the selected user role.
6. Question Answering via RAG
    Retrieve relevant chunks and generate role-specific answers using Gemini LLM.
7. Multiple Users / Roles on Same Data
    Support multiple users with different roles querying the same PDF.
8. Role-Based Answer Comparison
    Compare how different roles receive different answers to the same question.
9. Document Refresh & Re-indexing
    Replace or update PDFs and regenerate the vector database accordingly.
10. Error Handling for Edge Scenarios
     Handle issues like empty input, unsupported file types.
11. Role Management and Customization
     Add or modify user roles and corresponding prompt behavior dynamically.
12. Feedback Mechanism (Optional)
     Let users give feedback on the quality or helpfulness of an answer.
